## 🔹**RD-04: "The computational energy spectrum of a program as it executes" (2010)**

**Summary:** Proposes a method for measuring a program’s performance fluctuations over time using a computational energy spectrum and a concept called "computational action norm", inspired by physical action in mechanics.

**Relevance to DA:** While the work introduces analogies from physics (energy, action), it lacks formal application of dimensional analysis principles or derivation of dimensionless numbers relevant to software architecture.

✅ *Key Concepts:* Energy spectrum, performance variability, analogies to physics

❌ *Why excluded:* No explicit dimensional analysis framework, derivations, or dimensionless modeling.

## 🔹**RD-08: "A metric space for computer programs and the principle of computational least action" (2008)**

**Summary:** Defines a normed metric space for programs based on a computational action function derived from Hockney’s model and Newtonian dynamics, proposing a "Principle of Computational Least Action" to evaluate program efficiency.

**Relevance to DA:** The use of mechanical analogies (mass, momentum, force) is creative, but it doesn’t translate into a rigorous or testable dimensional analysis methodology, nor does it extract dimensionless groups as standard DA requires.

✅ *Key Concepts:* Action norm, metric space, optimization via least action

❌ *Why excluded:* Highly abstract, lacks concrete DA methods or validation.
