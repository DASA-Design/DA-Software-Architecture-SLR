### 📄 **Summary of Ruzicka (2008) – *On Dimensionless Numbers***

Ruzicka presents a detailed theoretical and historical overview of dimensionless numbers in physics and engineering, emphasizing their foundational role in characterizing physical processes, especially in transport phenomena (momentum, heat, and mass transfer). The paper highlights how dimensional analysis provides not just simplification but insight into the structure and similarity of models across domains, arguing for a deeper understanding of these numbers beyond their algebraic definition.

### 🔗 **Relation to Numrich’s Work**

Ruzicka’s treatment of dimensionless numbers provides a theoretical backbone that parallels and legitimizes Numrich’s application of similar principles in the software and computational performance domain. While Ruzicka focuses on physical transport systems, Numrich translates these ideas—particularly the use of dimensionless quantities and similarity principles into computer system performance. Both authors view dimensionless analysis as a method to expose invariant properties and simplify complex systems, though Ruzicka's focus is more foundational and Numrich's is more application-driven within software engineering.
