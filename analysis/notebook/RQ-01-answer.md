# 🔍 **RQ-01: What are the current applications of Dimensional Analysis in modern software development or architecture?**

## ✅ **Summary:**

Dimensional Analysis (DA) is being applied in software performance modeling, benchmarking, algorithm analysis, and system equivalence classification. The primary focus is on generating **dimensionless performance metrics** to enable cross-platform comparison, identify computational bottlenecks, and optimize parallel numerical algorithms.

## 🧠 **Patterns:**

* Most studies use DA to construct **performance models** and reduce system behaviour into  **dimensionless surfaces or metrics** .
* DA enables  **cross-system comparison** , identification of  **scaling limits** , and  **algorithm-specific optimizations** .
* Some studies extend DA to **force-based metaphors** (software vs hardware), emphasizing interpretability and machine classification.
