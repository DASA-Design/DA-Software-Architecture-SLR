# 🔍 **RQ-02: How do engineers use Dimensional Analysis in software development or architecture?**

## ✅ **Summary:**

Engineers use Dimensional Analysis (DA) in software development and architecture primarily to model execution behaviour, reduce complex performance formulas, derive dimensionless metrics, and compare systems across architectures. DA serves as a bridge between physical modeling concepts and computational performance optimization.
